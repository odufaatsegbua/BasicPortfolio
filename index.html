<h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hi--I'm Odufa! I'm 24-years-old and trying to live my best life the best way I can.</p>
    <p>I love meeting new people, traveling, writing and talking. I like to encourage people by sharing my past struggles and how I overcame them.
        I love asking people questions about their life and their reasons for choosing the path they are currently on, 
        whether that's a certain career path or spiritual path. I think the best ways to learn are by asking questions and experiencing failure.
        My favorite word is love because I love to love. Three things I always encourage people to do is to love God, love themselves and love others.
        I believe the world would be a better place if everyone lived by those three statements.
    </p>
