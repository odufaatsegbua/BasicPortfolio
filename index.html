        <p id="mainText">Hi, I'm Odufa! I'm 24-years-old and trying to live my best life the best way I can.
            I recieved my B.A in Advertising and Public Relations from Texas Tech University.
            <br>
            I love meeting new people, traveling, writing and talking. I like to encourage people by sharing my past
            struggles and how I overcame them. I love asking people questions about their life and their reasons for choosing the path they are currently
            on, whether that's a certain career path or spiritual path. I think the best ways to learn are by asking
            questions and experiencing failure.
            <br>
            My favorite word is love because I love to love. Three things I always encourage people to do is to love
            God, love themselves and love others. I believe the world would be a better place if everyone lived by those three statements.
